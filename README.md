# Astro Starter Template: MINIMAL

A very minimal starter template with some CSS resets. Note this template uses vanilla CSS.

There are no dependecies in this template so that it is fully customisable.

To use this template do the following:

1. clone to repo
2. `cd` into the repo
3. run `npm install`
4. I have set a ludicurous background `color` and `background-color`. Change the color in the `base.css`file on lines `47-48` for a sanity check that CSS is running as it should.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside this template Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
